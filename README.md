My personal website built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a JS-based static site generator. Static pages are generated based on data from `.js` and `.json` data files, as well as `.md` files (for blog posts), using mostly `.njk` templates.

To start the app, clone the repository, `npm install` and `npm start` to generate the static files in `dist` folder and run the app locally via Browsersync (default on `http://localhost:8080/`).
