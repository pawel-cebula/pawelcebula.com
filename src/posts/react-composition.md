Abstraction is one of the most fundamental concepts in programming:

>"the process of simplifying code by finding similarities between different parts of the code and extracting shared logic into a named component (such as a function, module, etc...), thereby reducing the amount of code required." ([EricElliott](https://ericelliottjs.com/premium-content/abstraction-and-composition))

By separating the code into independent units (i.e. functions or classes) you can reduce code duplication and increase reusability, while improving security and reliability of the application.

We use abstraction all the time in programming, whether by extracting frequently repeated operations into functions, or when importing internal or external modules and packages.

One of abstraction techniques is composition, which allows combining simpler data types into more complex ones ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition)). This technique exists in functional- as well as object-oriented programming, and React's composition model is one of its fundamental blocks.

## How to compose React components?

Imagine that you're building an app, where you will be often using a card to display information. The card will consist of three sections: `heading`, `main` and `actions`. While the `heading` and `actions` will be standardized across all cards, the `main` of a card might differ a lot between cards. You can achieve this through composition by using the special `children` prop, along with the custom props relating to `title`, `subTitle`, and `actions` with some default values.

```jsx
const Card = ({ title, subTitle, children, actions = ['like', 'comment'] }) => (
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-heading">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{subTitle}</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-main">{children}</div>
    <div class="card-actions">
      {actions.map((action) => (
        <button>{action}</button>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

With the `Card` component defined, you can already apply composition when using it in another component to display a list of items. The entire `ul` element will be passed to the `Card` component in the `children` prop.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>React composition</h1>
    <div class="cards">
      <Card title="Craft beer" subTitle="Most popular styles">
        <ul>
          <li>IPA</li>
          <li>Sour</li>
          <li>Stout</li>
        </ul>
      </Card>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

If you're not planning to use lists inside the `main` section of a `Card` in another places within your app, this is a perfectly valid approach. However, you're planning to have a lot of cards that will include a photo below the heading. In this case, you can again use composition in order to make the `Card` component more specialized and turn it into `PhotoCard`.

```jsx
const PhotoCard = ({ src, alt, children, ...rest }) => (
  <Card {...rest}>
    <img src={src} alt={alt} />
    {children}
  </Card>
);
```

`PhotoCard` introduces two new props, `src` and `alt`, which are necessary in order to display the photo. You can still  make this new component further customisable by allowing `children` to be passed. What is important to remember, is that you still need to capture the props from the `Card` component, such as `title`, `subTitle` and `actions`. You can do that efficiently by collecting them with a `...rest` operator and then spreading them into the `Card` component inside the `PhotoCard` component.

```jsx
<PhotoCard
  title="NEIPA"
  subTitle="New England India Pale Ale"
  src="https://www.beercartel.com.au/product_images/uploaded_images/neipa2017-cp.jpg"
  alt="NEIPA photo"
>
  <p>New England IPAs are beers that are purposely hazy or cloudy.</p>
</PhotoCard>
```

You can follow the same logic when creating another specialized variation of the card that you might use frequently, i.e. `TextCard`, which receives `paragraphs`, an array of strings as a prop. In this case, you can decide to no allow any further elements to be passed via `children` prop.

```jsx
const TextCard = ({ paragraphs, ...rest }) => (
  <Card {...rest}>
    {paragraphs.map((paragraph) => (
      <p>{paragraph}</p>
    ))}
  </Card>
);
```

You can now use the `TextCard` along with other `Card` variations within your app. By passing `actions` to the `TextCard`, you can also override the default values specified in the `Card` component.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const ipaInfo = [
    'India pale ale (IPA) is a hoppy beer style within the broader category of pale ale.',
    'The style of pale ale which became known as India pale ale was widespread in England by 1815, and would grow in popularity, notably as an export beer shipped to India and elsewhere.',
  ];

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React composition</h1>
      <div class="cards">
		// ...
        <TextCard
          title="IPA"
          subTitle="India Pale Ale"
          paragraphs={ipaInfo}
          actions={['save']}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

Composition is a very fundamental and powerful concept in React, as it makes it easier to manage your codebase  by avoiding repetition, while providing flexibility in situations where you don't know what you might want to render inside a component ahead of time, or if you want to customize a component into its more specialized variation.
