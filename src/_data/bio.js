  "I'm a full-stack software developer, who transitioned into tech after founding MEDIGO, a VC-funded healthtech and insurtech startup, where I was the COO and CCO for 7 years.",
  "I started learning to code out of curiosity, feeling that I don't have a deep enough understanding of how our tech was built.",
  'Very quickly, curiosity turned into passion and after a few months of learning and building, I knew that I want to become a full-time software developer.',
  "After starting my learning journey with Python and Django, I have been focusing on web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Along with my daily stack, I'm always learning about new technologies and have recently been exploring TypeScript, GraphQL, Vue.js and TailwindCSS.",
  'I love solving problems and as a developer I can do that much more effectively and efficiently, whether working with others or on personal projects.',
