  'I\'m a full-stack software developer, who transitioned into tech after founding a healthtech and insurtech startup, where I was the COO and CCO for 7 years.',
  'I started learning to code in January 2020, partly out of curiosity and partly out of frustration from not understanding this somewhat intimidating but crucial part of what we were doing.',
  'Very quickly, curiosity and frustration turned into passion and after a few months of learning and building, I was confident that I want to make a career swith and become software developer.',
