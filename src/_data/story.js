This took me for an exchange year to Hong Kong, and for my masters to Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Nanjing (China), and all across Asia in between. Those years helped me appreciate different cultures, perspectives and viewpoints.",
      "During those 6 years, I’ve played online poker semi-profesionally. Studying and playing the game in a serious way taught me a lot about probability, game theory, decision making and managing your own psychology. Who would've guessed how useful these skills would become in the startup world.",

      "After graduating from university, I decided to move to Berlin to join its growing tech ecosystem. I worked briefly for a well-known angel investor, before founding Medigo, with a mission to improve access to quality healthcare globally.",
      "We raised funds from some great angels and VCs (i.e. Atlantic Labs, Accel Partners), grew the team to 50+ full-time employees, and helped over 200,000 patients access high quality healthcare across 5 continents.",
      "During those 7 years, as the COO and CCO, I've built up and managed a lot of functional areas that I’ve never dealt with before: operations, business development, marketing, finance, HR and legal. The life of a startup founder is challenging and the learning curve was incredibly steep but I can't imagine a better opportunity to compress a lifetime of experiences and insights into several years.",
