      "We managed to raise funds from some great angels (i.e. Atlantic Labs) and VCs (i.e. Accel Partners), grow the team to 50+ full-time employees, and help over 200,000 patients to access high quality healthcare across 5 continents."

      "While I’ve learned a ton at Medigo and wouldn’t trade this experience for anything, I felt that something was missing and I had a blind spot. I was curious about the work of our tech team but I had little chance to interact with them on a daily basis.",
      "In January 2020, I started learning to code and I’ve not looked back since. After learning some fundamentals of computer science while getting familiar with Python, I’ve decided to focus on web development, initially working with Django, before moving on to the JavaScript ecosystem.",
      "Since July 2020, I’ve been primarily working with HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, relational and document databases.", 
      "I love learning about new technologies and have recently been spending some time with TypeScript, GraphQL and TailwindCSS. I'm keen to continue working with a wide range of technologies but I'm also looking forward to going deep on some of the topics.",
      "I’m very thankful for the amazing resources I’ve had at my disposal, including online courses and tutorials, books, documentation, and very supportive (and incredibly generous with their time) friends and mentors.",
      "The most powerful learning tool, however, has certainly been working on personal projects, which pushed me out of my comfort zone and exposed me to the daily challenges and struggles of figuring things out on your own. I’m happy to say that over the time I’ve been able to significantly reduce the frequency with which I’ve been annoying my patient developer friends and instead now rely primarily on documentation or countless blog posts, tutorials and Stack Overflow threads.",
      "I'm now ready to start my first developer and I can't wait to continue learning inside a company with a strong engineering culture"
